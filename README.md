# TeleEngine.NET
Simple API extension of [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET), that is providing pure graphical engine feel, but
in a low level form

---
## Informations
- This version of project is really unstable, so you can expect a lot of breaking changes with or overall new implementations
- After first stable version, we are going to provide a backwards compatibility
- The code documentation is one the most prioritize implementation, so it should be done until first stable release
- After some time, when this project will be in a usable form, we are going to provide specific benchmarks

### TODO
- [x] Loading vertices from .obj, .stl, .dae, .abc -> 25%
- [ ] Generating shaders from C# implementation
- [x] Having at least two build in camera components -> Y orientation is causing weird translations
- [ ] Create a proper documentation
- [ ] Having any type of editor form (This is going to be a next project, because this repository is trying to keep code as low level as possible)
- [x] Create highly abstract input manager -> 50% (Keyboard, Mouse)
